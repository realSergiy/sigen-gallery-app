**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.** A clear and concise description
of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...]

**Describe the solution you'd like** A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

## Importance

Goal Contribution:

- clear long term impact on success
- impacts what really matters
- moves toward the goal
- top importance tasks cannot be avoided at all

Explain how this work:

- contributes to a priority
- changes reputation, status, relationships or finances
- aligns with core values
- directly related to objectives

Apply the above tests from both 'what if done' and 'what if not done' angles. Measure **importance**
with XS, S, M, L, XL

## Urgency

Time Sensitivity:

- clear consequences if not done ON TIME (urgent client request)
- the longer delay the worse it becomes (fixing busted pipe)

Establish deadline

Deadline examples:

- has to coincide with external events
- escalates into bigger issue (something breaks, opportunity lost etc.): when = deadline
- is a prereq for an itemB: deadline <= itemB deadline
- gets worse the longer it postponed
- has someone waiting, so they could move forward

Measure (1,2,4,7,12) **urgency** with `days x K` till deadline

## Effort

Depends on scope and complexity of the item. Measure **effort** as dev-hours

## Measurements

- XS = 1
- S = 2
- M = 4
- L = 7
- XL = 12
